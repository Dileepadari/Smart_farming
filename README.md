<h2>Problem Statement:</h2>

<p>propose an IOT system to sense VOCs for accurately predicting onset of pathogen attack on the plant. A network on VOC sensor, temperature, humidity (soil), light, O2/CO2 can be deployed on the farm. In the project, these above mentioned sensor will be interfaced and deployed on an experimental farm (plants). Response to any stress introduced will be recorded via change in temperature, humidity & VOC levels of the plants.</p>
