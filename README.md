## Problem Statement:

 <p style = "color :#16DE2A;">Propose an IOT system to sense VOCs for accurately predicting onset of pathogen attack on the plant. A network on VOC sensor, temperature, humidity (soil), light, O2/CO2 can be deployed on the farm. In the project, these above mentioned sensor will be interfaced and deployed on an experimental farm (plants). Response to any stress introduced will be recorded via change in temperature, humidity & VOC levels of the plants.</p>
	
## Motivation

## Sensors 

`DHT(11)` :  Temperature & Humidity (Range: Temp -> 0 - 50 C ; Humidity -> )
Working Principle :
<br>

`Soil Moisture`:<br>
Working Principle : 
- The Soil Moisture sensor uses capacitance to measure dielectric permittivity of the surrounding medium to measure the soil moisture.
- In soil the dielectric permittivity is function of water content.When water content increases the dielectric permittivity also increase.So when dielectric permittivity is high then the Voltage measured across the `Soil Moisture` pins decreases.

`SGP30` : CO<sub>2</sub> and VOC <br>
Working Principle : 
- SGP30 uses Metal-oxide semiconductor to detect various gases.The sensor has MOX(Metal Oxide) and ASIC(Application Specific Integrated Circuit).
- `SGP30` mainly measures the concentrations of CO<sub>2</sub> and TVOCs.The MOX sensor reacts to the presence of these gases ,causing changes in it's electric conductivity.
- The ASIC then converts these changes into digital signals , which are used to calculate the gas concentrations.
