## Problem Statement:

 <p style = "color :#16DE2A;">Propose an IOT system to sense VOCs for accurately predicting onset of pathogen attack on the plant. A network on VOC sensor, temperature, humidity (soil), light, O2/CO2 can be deployed on the farm. In the project, these above mentioned sensor will be interfaced and deployed on an experimental farm (plants). Response to any stress introduced will be recorded via change in temperature, humidity & VOC levels of the plants.</p>

## Motivation

## Sensors 
`DHT(11)` :  Temperature & Humidity (Range: Temp -> 0 - 50 C ; Humidity -> 20% to 90%)

Working Principle : The DHT11 is a temperature and humidity sensor that operates by measuring changes in resistance of a humidity-sensitive element(polymer) and built in thermistor in response to temperature and humidity variations. It converts these changes into digital signals for microcontrollers to read.â€‹

Humidity-Sensitive Resistor (Polymer): The resistance of a humidity-sensitive resistor, often made of polymers, decreases with increasing humidity. As humidity increases, the polymer absorbs moisture, causing its conductivity to increase and, consequently, lowering its resistance.

Thermistor (Temperature-Sensitive Resistor): The resistance of a thermistor decreases with increasing temperature. Thermistors are designed to have a negative temperature coefficient (NTC), meaning their resistance decreases as the temperature rises. This characteristic makes them suitable for temperature sensing applications.
